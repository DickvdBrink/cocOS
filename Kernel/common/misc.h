// TODO: Horribly hardwired for small-memory configurations at the moment. Will overwrite the VM structures if we go above 1024
// MiB of RAM... vm32.c should be patched to calculate this and return it. I did an attempt but managed to screw up the code
// completely, making the CPU reset every time you go to long mode... :)
